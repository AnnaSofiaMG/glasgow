## What is HacktoberFest?

> HacktoberFest is an annual month-long celebration of open source software encouraging meaningful contributions to any open source project. Its run by DigitialOcean in partnership with GitHub and Dev and anyone can participate whether you are a first time contributor or a veteran!

### But what is open source software (OSS)?
**Simply put...**
>‚ÄúOpen source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
Its authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.‚Äù

The principles of open source that OS projects should strive for:
- **Transparency**
-- Transparency not only of the code itself, but the decision making and processes involved in the project
- **Collaboration**
-- Collaboration on a platform with other fellow contributors all working towards common goals which is often reflected by the OSS project's vision
- **Participation & Community**
-- Make anything a Contribution! Encouraging participation in many forms whether you're a developer, writer, or end user will help grow a healthy and vibrant communnity

### Ok, but what impact does this have?

**Huge Impact!**  Every contribution helps! We can not stress enough that your PR, which could contain a bug fix; typo correction; new feature; or even broken link fix is appreciated by the hard working maintainers of the projects. These maintainers are often working silly hours volunteerly because they believe in their project. So seeing PRs that are well formed, descriptive and open for collaboration the maintainers acknolwedge that:
- You use or enjoy the software/project
- You are willing to help out (what a huge boost!)
- You code will impact others using the project for the better!

 In most things, including Open Soure Software, you get out what you put in and often skimming the surface of OS you're not going to find its true benefits. But if we can give back to our favourite projects by our contribution then we can have a positive impact on others using the software as well as driving it.
